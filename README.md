## Project Description

The goal of this project was for me to practice manipulating objects in the JavaScript DOM. I got to practice using the following methods:

- `location.reload()`
- `document.querySelector()`
- `element.textContent`

The main challenge was to figure out how to create the functions `showMeme()`, `showJoke()`, and `showQuote()` as this was my first time using event-driven development.

I am excited about continuing to build projects using JavaScript.

## Instructions for Use

1. Open the live site in your web browser.

2. Click the "Show a Meme 🖼️", "Tell Me a Joke 😂", or "Random Quote 🔖" button to generate a random meme, joke, or quote about ChatGPT. Click the 'Clear All 🧹" button to reload the page. 

3. Enjoy! Click the button again to generate a new meme, joke, or quote.

Thank you for using the Random ChatGPT Meme, Joke, and Quote Generator! 💙
